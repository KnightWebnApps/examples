# Using SvelteKit to build your ChatGPT Plugin Endpoint

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ ChatGPT Plugins are still in beta as of July 9, 2023.  You will need to have access to the beta to test and use your plugin.

# Overview

We will simply provide an arbitrary list of todos if the user asks for it. This example is meant to show how to setup a SvelteKit project to start handling requests from OpenAI.

## Specs

First we need to add a openapi.yaml and ai-plugin.json to our project. As per the SvelteKit docs, static assets live in the static folder. So letâ€™s add a /.well-known folder and put the files here.

Our ai-plugin.json will look like this.

```json
{
  "schema_version": "v1",
  "name_for_human": "TODO Lister",
  "name_for_model": "TODOLister",
  "description_for_human": "List arbitrary todos.",
  "description_for_model": "You will list todos when prompted by the user.",
  "auth": {
    "type": "none"
  },
  "api": {
    "type": "openapi",
    "url": "http://localhost:5173/.well-known/openapi.yaml",
    "has_user_authentication": false
  },
  "logo_url": "http://localhost:5173/favicon.png",
  "contact_email": "example@gmail.com",
  "legal_info_url": "http://www.example.com/legal"
}
```

And our openapi.yaml will look like this.

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.1
info:
  title: TODO Lister
  description: A plugin that lists arbitrary todos.
  version: "v1"
servers:
  - url: http://localhost:5173
paths:
  /api/todos:
    get:
      operationId: getTodos
      summary: Get list of tasks.
      responses:
        "200":
          description: OK
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: "#components/schemas/getTodoResponse"
components:
  schemas:
    getTodosResponse:
      type: object
      properties:
        todos:
          type: array
          items:
            type: string
          description: The list of todos.
```

## Endpoint

GPT expects a GET request to live at [http://localhost:5173/api/todos](http://localhost:5173/api/todos). When you are building this out in your own project you will need to specify each endpoints path, operations, and those operations requestBodyâ€™s and responses.

This is what our server endpoint will look like.

```tsx
import { json } from "@sveltejs/kit";
import type { RequestHandler } from "./$types";

export const GET: RequestHandler = async ({ fetch, request }) => {
  return json(
    { todos: ["Go to the grocery store.", "Build a ChatGPT plugin"] },
    { statusText: "OK", status: 200 }
  );
};
```

## CORS

To allow ChatGPT to access our endpoint we need to change the request headers when their API hits our endpoint. We can do this in our hooks.server.ts file.

```tsx
export const handle: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
  const origin = event.request.headers.get("origin");

  if (origin && origin === "https://chat.openai.com") {
    // * This needs to be here to allow the request
    if (event.request.method === "OPTIONS") {
      return new Response(null, {
        headers: {
          "Access-Control-Allow-Methods":
            "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS",
          "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
          "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "*",
        },
      });
    }
    event.request.headers.append("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", origin);
    return await resolve(event);
  }
  return await resolve(event);
};
```

### Testing

Last thing we need to do is test it out in the ChatGPT UI.

Start by developing your own plugin, you can follow the official docs [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/getting-started/running-a-plugin).

Then simply ask for your todos.

### Next Steps

- Auth: If your endpoints require authorization you will need to change your auth strategy for your production plugin
- Get user input: Get data like files, tasks, images, etc. to use in your endpoints
- Improve description_for_model, descriptions and summaries to improve responses from GPT
